	<p>Sip your Tea
	Nice and Slow
	No one Ever knows
	when it’s Time to Go,
	There’ll be no Time
	to enjoy the Glow,
	So sip your Tea
	Nice and Slow.

	<p>Life is too Short but
	feels pretty Long,
	There’s too Much to do, so much going Wrong,
	And Most of the Time You Struggle to be Strong,
	Before it’s too Late
	and it’s time to Go,
	Sip your Tea
	Nice and Slow.
